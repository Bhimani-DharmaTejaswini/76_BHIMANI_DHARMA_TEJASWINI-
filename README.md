F4-Transaction Fraud Detection(Imbalanced Classification)
Problem:Detect fraudulent payments in a skewed dataset,report precision/recall
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent mobile money transactions using machine learning techniques on a highly imbalanced dataset. The model predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent and provides a fraud probability (%), helping financial systems flag high-risk transactions efficiently.

The solution is built using the PaySim synthetic financial dataset, which closely simulates real mobile money transaction behavior.
